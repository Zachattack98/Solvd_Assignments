A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation describing an abstract machine[1] that manipulates symbols
on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.[2] Despite the model's simplicity, it is capable of implementing
any computer algorithm.[3]

The machine operates on an infinite[4] memory tape divided into discrete cells,[5] each of which can hold a single
symbol drawn from a finite set of symbols called the alphabet of the machine. It has a "head" that, at any point in
the machine's operation, is positioned over one of these cells, and a "state" selected from a finite set of states.
At each step of its operation, the head reads the symbol in its cell. Then, based on the symbol and the machine's
own present state, the machine writes a symbol into the same cell, and moves the head one step to the left or the
right,[6] or halts the computation. The choice of which replacement symbol to write and which direction to move is
based on a finite table that specifies what to do for each combination of the current state and the symbol that is read.

The Turing machine was invented in 1936 by Alan Turing,[7][8] who called it an "a-machine" (automatic machine).[9] It
was Turing's Doctoral advisor, Alonzo Church, who later coined the term "Turing machine" in a review.[10] With this
model, Turing was able to answer two questions in the negative:

Does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape is "circular" (e.g., freezes, or
fails to continue its computational task)?
Does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape ever prints a given symbol?
